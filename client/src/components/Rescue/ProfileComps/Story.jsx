            <p>Meet Xena! Xena is a relaxed and lovable 5yr old Calico girl. She enjoys sitting on the couch and loves her meals and snacks. Xena greets her foster mom upon entering the room and even gives vocal welcomes. Xena would do best with other calm natured kitties as she avoids confrontation but will defend herself against other kitties that are too assertive.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Xena loved her previous owner who was disabled and unfortunately had to surrender this little love. Xena allows petting, head scratches and head bumps and wants to sit by her foster mom for company whether she is in the kitchen or any other room of the house.</p>
