    Adoption Process
</h1>
<p>Our adoption process is people friendly and we welcome the opportunity to work with people looking to adopt. Our adoption process consists of a short application and a meet where you can get to know the animal you are interested in. Once you find the perfect match, we ask adopters to sign an adoption contract and give a donation to help us rescue the next animal in need. We process applications in the order in which they were received. By providing comprehensive behavioral information about the animal and gathering relevant information about the prospective home environment, we work with each applicant to match them with a compatible animal.</p></div>
