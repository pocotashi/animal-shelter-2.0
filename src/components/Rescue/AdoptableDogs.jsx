        Jory was surrendered to the city shelter with parvovirus. She arrived at the emergency vet hospital so lethargic that she was falling asleep standing up. Doctors treated her for several days before her condition began improving and she regained an appetite. 
        <br/>
        Day-by-day, Jory began to perk up and she was finally stable enough for us to transfer her into foster care just recently. Jory's foster reports that she's an extremely sweet dog who bonds with her human(s) very quickly. She's a total lap dog who wants to be with you at all times! 
        <br/>
        Jory is ready for a new home! She may still be shedding parvovirus, which is not contagious to humans or cats. If her new adopter has other dogs, our animal care staff should talk to you about how best to keep your pets safe. Please contact Animal Haven for more information on Jory! </div><div class="adopt"><a class="btn btn-primary" href="/#supportme" target="_blank">Donate to my Care</a><a class="btn btn-primary" href="/adoptionsurvey" target="_blank">General Questions?</a>

            Adoption Process
        </h1>
<p>Our adoption process is people friendly and we welcome the opportunity to work with people looking to adopt. Our adoption process consists of a short application and a meet where you can get to know the animal you are interested in. Once you find the perfect match, we ask adopters to sign an adoption contract and give a donation to help us rescue the next animal in need. We process applications in the order in which they were received. By providing comprehensive behavioral information about the animal and gathering relevant information about the prospective home environment, we work with each applicant to match them with a compatible animal.</p></div>
