<h1>The Myth of Sarama</h1>
<p>The name of our rescue was inspired by the myth of Sarama, the dog of the gods. Sarama is said to be the mother of animals as well as their protector. She aims to change people’s view point that animals are lesser beings.</p>

Our rescue follows Sarama’s beliefs, and it vows to protect and nurture any animal who needs our care. Animals need kindness, love, and respect as much as we do. Through rescue, education, and advocacy we hope to not only save animals but inspire the community to help us create a more compassionate world for the animals.</p>
