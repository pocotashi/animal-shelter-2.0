    <h1>Recent Success Story</h1>
    <h6>Our First Petco Adoption Event</h6>
    <p className="rEvent-text">Rocky, the adorable senior Havanese pup, came to us when his owners couldnâ€™t care for any longer. They were struggling to find a place to live themselves and couldnâ€™t manage Rockyâ€™s medical care. We promised he would get the care he needed and find him a loving permanent home.</p></div>
